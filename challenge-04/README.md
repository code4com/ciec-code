# Challenge - 04

#### Files provided:
```
├── challenge-04
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── input_fqdn.csv
│   └── sample_output.csv
```
- How to use files:
   - `input_fqdn.csv` use as input to your code 
   - `sample_output.csv` sample of the desired output formatting

####  Coding Tasks
- For each FQDN, in 'input_fqdn.csv`, extract the following values:
  | field  | description |
  |---------|--------------|
  | IP  | The IPv4 address rendered from a DNS query |
  | DNS_time_ms  | Time (in ms) your code took to resolve DNS and get the IP |
  | HTTP_handshake_time_ms  | Time (in ms) your code took to make an HTTP Request handshake |


- Use your preferred programming/scripting language, to code your solution.
- In your solution code: try to handle all the possible input types and errors.
- Hint: You may need to import some Network Programming Modules

####  Code-Design Concepts to Consider
- Pay attention to ways you would manage and improve your code for:
   - Scalability (when list has 50,000+ websites)
   - Reliability
   - Speed
   - Maintainability
   - Observability
   - Testability
   - Ease of deployment

####  Extra Credit
- How would you containerization your code for deployment?
- Give details on how you would manage dependency requirements.

####  Submission of Work
- Submit/commit your code as *new* files in your personal repo folder
   - Name your repo folder: `challenge-04`
- Please provide complete written instructions on how to use your solution files. 
     - e.g. Like how to run, build, deploy, etc.
