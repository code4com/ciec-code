## Ask
- Please find `configs` folder which has csv file and a json file

- your task is to write a simple python code to read from CSV file and update json file.
- we should pass ENV as runtime parameter, based on which python code only update that part of json file leaving other json elements untouched.

- runtime CLI command should look like but may not exactly.
```
#python3 ./updatejson.py --env DEV --json ./config.json --csv ./input.csv
```
- Submit/commit your code as a new file/s to your personal repo folder named challenge-03
